                    I have over 2.5 years experience in using <a href="https://www.image-line.com/">FL Studio</a>
                    as well as a year's experience in using LogicX Pro and Pro Tools. I have worked in a Studio

                    I have experience in Sound Desgin such as Creating, Editing and Timing Sound Effects to film. 
                    I have experience in using a Foley Pit for making footsteps and other such Foley.

                            I have developed multiple small indie-games all of which are kinda-playable in the Unity Game 
                            Engine. For over the last year or so, I have also used FMOD Studio in my game development which
                            has helped my games become more immersive, and interactive.

                                I have worked in multiple environments with many types of gears like Amps, Synths and many Kinds of microphones.
                                I know how to use many different microphone recording techniques such as XY mic-ing; Where 2 microphones are
                                recording 90&deg; to eachother like in the image on the right.

                                    I also have experience working quite hectic in teams which still yielded excellent quality work. Although leading
                                    a team isn't my strong suit, I am a strong team member who fills their role and can fill in where others' don't
                                    meet their parts.

                <p>
                    I have many favourable qualities such as:
                </p>

                <h2>Punctuality</h2>
                <p>
                    I am very punctual, meaning I can complete any task set before me and a date to finish it by. An Evidence of this is the many
                    <a href="https://itch.io/jams">Game Jams</a> that I have participated in such as Pirate Software Game Jam 
                    <a href="https://nixian001.itch.io/project-nx-foundation-assessment">14</a>,
                    <a href="https://nixian001.itch.io/project-nx-overshadowed">15</a>,
                    and <a href="https://nixian001.itch.io/project-nx-escape-route">16</a>, 
                    as-well-as Chili Code Game Jam
                    <a href="https://nixian001.itch.io/rrr">3</a> and 
                    <a href="https://nixian001.itch.io/exterminate">4</a>
                </p>

                <h2>Resilience</h2>
                <p>
                    I have a particular ablitity to not crack under stress and pressure, meaning even if I am put into a stressful situatuion, I am
                    capable of continuing to do my work to satisfaction.
