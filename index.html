                <p>
                    I have over 2.5 years experience in using <a href="https://www.image-line.com/">FL Studio</a>
                    as well as a year's experience in using LogicX Pro and Pro Tools. I have worked in a Studio
                    Environment and recording live instruments such as Synths &amp; Drums, Reamping, and Composing.
                </p>
                <h2>Sound Design</h2>
                <p>
                    I have experience in Sound Desgin such as Creating, Editing and Timing Sound Effects to film. 
                    I have experience in using a Foley Pit for making footsteps and other such Foley.
                </p>

                        <p>
                            I have developed multiple small indie-games all of which are kinda-playable in the Unity Game 
                            Engine. For over the last year or so, I have also used FMOD Studio in my game development which
                            has helped my games become more immersive, and interactive.
                        </p>
